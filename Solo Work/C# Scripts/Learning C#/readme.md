This is my current learning path on c#. I'm planning on spending about 10-20 minutes each **possible** day programming with c# for at a maximum (in how many days i spent programming),
a month. Im planning on learning for a simple and easy an app with gui. Firstly i need to learn the basics before i start. This is only 
inteneded to save my work and keep a track on it for the future and etc.

As You can see there might be a delay between days, i am very busy and its difficult to squeeze some time in for programming. I am currently trying to find as much time as possible to reduce the gaps in my learning journey, but it'll take a while so please cope with me. If so for any reason you're reading this or following along right now, hahaha.
