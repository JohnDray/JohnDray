This is my current learning path on c#. I'm planning on spending about 10-20 minutes each day programming with c# for at a maximum,
a month. Im planning on learning for a simple and easy an app with gui. Firstly i need to learn the basics before i start. This is only 
inteneded to save my work and keep a track on it for the future and etc.
